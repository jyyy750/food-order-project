<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
  My first intention for this project was to do something that could showcase my SQL skillsets. I found out that by just displaying a few tables in the database, it would be too hard and abstract for the readers to comprehend what's going on. Therefore, with the help of PHP programming languages, a website would be accessible and understandable.
  
  
  Here's an short overview of the project:
  *	A food order website implemented by PHP and MySQL, which is composed of two parts: the frontend and the backend.
  *	Build a client-facing frontend that shows available food in a variety of categories. It also enables registered customers to place orders.
  *	The backend would be used by admins to manage food, category, registered customers and orders.
  *	All the data above would be stored in the database in MySQL.

### Built With

Major frameworks that I built my project using:
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)


<!-- VISUAL SHOWCASE -->
## Visual Showcase
  Compared to brief in long words, I think it would be more understandable to show visually. So I include the link of the video and some screenshots below.

### Video Walk-through
